Lost and Found Tracker :-
📌 Project Overview

The Lost and Found Tracker is a small Python program created to help people record items that they have either lost or found. In places like schools, colleges, and offices, belongings often get misplaced, and there is no proper system to track them.
This project provides a simple menu-based tool where users can enter item details and check if any lost item matches a found one.

📌 Features

✨ Add Lost Items

Users can enter what they lost, where they lost it, and their name.

✨ Add Found Items

Users can record details of items they found along with the finder’s name.

✨View Lost Items

Shows all items added to the lost list.

✨View Found Items

Shows all items added to the found list.

✨Match Lost & Found

The system compares both lists and shows possible matches based on item names.

✨Simple Menu Interface

The program is easy to use and works through a numbered menu.

📌 Problem Statement

Many lost items remain unclaimed because people don’t have an organized way to record or find them. This project solves that by creating a simple digital tracker where users can quickly log lost or found items and check for matches.
